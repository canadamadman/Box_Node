# Box_Node
I designed this as i needed a very small node to put in a box im trying to reuse

A PCB design that is based off the DIY Pro-Micro, Firmware for Meshtastic. This is a smd version that can be ordered and just need to add the promicro and the lora chip(HT-RA62 footprint). Battery holder will also be needed separately as well. I'm open to improvements and modifications.
